# Clustering-Assignment 102103140

In this assignment we had to perform different clustering algorithms using different pre-processing techniques with different numbers of clusters on different evaluation parameters.

I have used Pycaret in this assignment.

The dataset that I have used is wholesale Dataset.

## The three clustering techniques I have used are:

K means Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
K means shift Clustering


## The Parameters I have taken are:

Silhouette
Calinski-Harabasz
Davies-Bouldin

## The Pre-Processing techniques I have used are:

None
Normalization
PCA (Principle Component Analysis)
Transform
PCA+T
PCA+T+N
